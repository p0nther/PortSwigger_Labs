# what is summary info_disc


	Information disclosure (Information leakage)

	├─ Definition
	│  └─ Unintended exposure of sensitive information to users or attackers
	├─ Common examples
	│  ├─ robots.txt → reveals hidden directories
	│  ├─ directory listing → exposes folder contents
	│  ├─ source/backups accessible (index.bak, .zip, .sql)
	│  ├─ verbose/error messages revealing DB/table/column names
	│  ├─ developer comments in HTML/JS
	│  ├─ hard-coded API keys / credentials in code
	│  ├─ leaking usernames or resource existence via behavioral differences
	│  └─ tech-stack metadata: framework versions, directory structure, IPs
	├─ Root causes
	│  ├─ failing to remove internal content from public site (dev comments, backups)
	│  ├─ insecure configuration or debugging enabled in production
	│  └─ flawed application design → distinct responses revealing state (enum)
	├─ Impact / severity
	│  ├─ Direct: sensitive user/business data leaked (e.g., credit cards) → high
	│  ├─ Indirect: technical info used to discover further vulnerabilities → contextual
	│  └─ Severity depends on sensitivity + exploitability of leaked info
	├─ Assessment guidance
	│  ├─ Ask: can an attacker do something harmful with the info?
	│  ├─ Info about versions only matters if vulnerable/patchable exploit exists
	│  └─ Prioritize proof-of-exploit over logging mere presence of leakage
	├─ How to find & exploit (practical steps)
	│  ├─ Recon: inspect HTTP headers, metadata, robots.txt, sitemap
	│  ├─ Directory/URL brute-forcing for backups and source files
	│  ├─ Force errors to observe verbose server responses
	│  ├─ Check cloud buckets, open S3, misconfigured storage
	│  ├─ Search code/config for hard-coded secrets or credentials
	│  ├─ Use timing/response differences for username/resource enumeration
	│  └─ Correlate discovered versions with CVEs / public exploits
	└─ Mitigations / best practices
	   ├─ Principle
	   │  ├─ Separate dev/test from production; disable debug/diagnostics in prod
	   │  ├─ Use generic error messages; avoid revealing internal state
	   │  └─ Define and document what is "sensitive" for the org
	   ├─ Process
	   │  ├─ Automated code audits and secret scanning in CI (strip dev comments)
	   │  ├─ Threat-model third-party tech and disable unused features
	   │  └─ Use secret management instead of embedding credentials
	   └─ Tools & monitoring
	      ├─ SAST/DAST scanners, secret-detection tools
	      ├─ Hardened configuration for servers and storage (S3, buckets, indexes)
	      └─ Logging/alerts that avoid exposing sensitive data in logs




# labs

lab.1 -> in param  /product?productId=2 | it expect number in it , so what happen if i  put string like /product?productId="2" it gives me error that i show the version of server.

lab.2 -> I search in html page about any comment so i found the path /cgi-bin/phpinfo.php so i go to it and i show all info about php also the SECRET_KEY .

lab.3 -> i trying robots.txt then i found /backup i can access it so i read it 'the source code' i found username,password for DB.

lab.4 -> i do  fuzz on root  dir and found /admin when i go to access it , tell me admin interface only for local user . so i try to add X-Forwarded-For ,more haeder .... but not work , so i must to debug the request with HTTP Method TRACE to show if there is any header added in my req in network layer ,server,backend .TRACE /admin HMMMMMMMMMM i found  new header in the resposne named X-Custom-Ip-Authorization: , add it in my req and add internal ip like 127.0.0.1 .


lab.5 -> i must learn more about git cli in console
